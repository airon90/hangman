# hangman
This is a basic Hangman game written in Python. Words are automatically taken from [Wikidata](https://wikidata.org) lexemes: you can play with every language you want, as long as in the Wikidata item of your favorite language P218 (code for ISO 639) is defined.

SPARQLWrapper is used to get words, so it must be installed on your computer.
